    "description": "Cakes come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, textures and flavors. Although cheesecake is much like a pie in that it has a creamy texture and rests on pie crusts, it is also considered a cake. On the Cake page, you will find layer cakes, angel food cakes, bundt cakes, coffee cakes, muffins, cupcakes, pound cakes, cinnamon rolls and yes, cheesecake! Shown here is a delicious melt-in-your-mouth Angel Food Cake with Caramel Fluff.",
